# linux_stuff

Here you find my setup files (dotfile) for a linux environment
of my personal taste.
It works with debian based distros such as:
Debian,(K/L)Ubuntu, Bunsenlabs, DietPi, Raspi OS, Mint ...

it includes configuration for:

## bash
- nice command aliases (like ll for ls -al  etc..)
- 'nano' is alias for mirco
- exa as ls replacement
- console prompt "borrowed" from Kali Linux
- colourful greeting message with neofetch figlet and lolcat
- golang settings

## Midnight commander
- lynx-like motion enabled

## nano
- line numbers
- colors
- syntax highlighting

## micro
- crisp high-contrast color scheme

## alacritty
- dark classic high-contrast theme
- Fira Code font

## herbstluftwm
- configurable for small/large screens and different apps
- green focus
- polybar
- switch off laptop screen when a monitor is connected to HDMI-1
### important keybindings (some are herbstluft-default)

	win-alt-b        open web browser
	win-alt-n        open file browser (i.e. nemo)
	win-Esc          close current window
    win-, and  win-. navigate through tags (workspaces)

    win-space        open program launcher
    win-shift-q      logout

to your needs.

# Installation
There is an installer script which is able to install the needed dependencies and to symlink the dotfiles.

	./install

without any parameters it prints the usage.

The install script basically installs the dependencies on ubuntu/debian based systens and 
renames old dotfiles and symlinks to the ones from this package.
If you are not on a debian-based distro you need to install the deendencies yourself and invoke the installer with
	./install -d
to symlink the dotfiles only.
