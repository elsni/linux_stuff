# linux_stuff

Here you find my setup files for my linux console environment.

it includes:
- nice command aliases (like ll for ls -al  etc..)
- console prompt "borrowed" from Kali Linux
- Midnight Commander (mc) configuration
- nano editor configuration
- colourful greeting message with neofetch figlet and lolcat

These are configuration files for my personal taste.

Unless otherwise stated, the config files should work in any linux distro.

The install script installs all dependencies for you, use it like

    sudo ./install
