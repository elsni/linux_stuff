# linux_stuff

Here you find my setup files for my linux console environment.

it includes:
- nice command aliases (like ll for ls -al  etc..)
- console prompt "borrowed" from Kali Linux
- Midnight Commander (mc) configuration
- nano editor configuration

configuration files for my personal taste.

Unless otherwise stated, the config files should work in any linux distro.
Make sure you have nano, mc and neofetch installed.
